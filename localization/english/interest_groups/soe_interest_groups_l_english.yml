 ig_gertradeunions:0 "Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands"
 ig_gertradeunions_desc:0 "The SPD's story is one of resilience, adaptability, and steadfast commitment to their vision of a more just and equal society. The party is defined by its core principles of social democracy, workers' rights, and progressive reforms. Its influence extends far beyond the confines of the political arena. The party's affiliation with trade unions and its dedication to improving the working conditions and welfare of the German labor force have made the party a vital force in the labor movement."
 ig_gerpetty:0 "Nationalliberale Deutsche Volkspartei"
 ig_gerpetty_desc:0 "The Nationalliberale Deutsche Volkspartei, National Liberal German People's Party (NLDVP), represents the far-right and radical wing of the Deutsche Volkspartei. Their platform is characterized by nationalist fervor, populism, and an emphasis on a strong, centralized government. At its core, the NLDVP seeks to abolish the monarchy in pursuit of a vision of German nationalism and empowerment. They argue that Germans are still suppressed under the monarchy's authority, viewing the monarchy as a symbol of the old order that needs to be dismantled."
 ig_gerarmed:0 "Bundeswehr"
 ig_gerarmed_desc:0 "The Bundeswehr led Germany to victory in the Great War, a combined force of all German states. Prussian discipline, military strategy, and regimented training define the Bundeswehr's identity. Wilhelm II, a figure who has had his fair share of controversies in recent time, casts a long shadow over the Bundeswehr. Concerns persist that he may exploit the army's Prussian leadership and military might to further his own ambitions, raising questions about the stability of the German Empire."
 ig_gerrural:0 "Reichslandbund"
 ig_gerdevout:0 "Zentrumspartei"
 ig_gerdevout_desc:0 "The Zentrumspartei stands as a bulwark of moderation and cooperation in a Europe marred by the scars of the Great War. As the political embodiment of Catholicism, the party's commitment to Christian values and social justice resonates deeply with a populace seeking moral guidance in an ever-changing world. Amid the specter of economic challenges and political upheaval, the party has consistently advocated for cooperation and compromise between Germany's various regions and interest groups."
 ig_gerindustry:0 "Hanseatischer Volksbund"
 ig_gerintel:0 "Deutsche Volkspartei"
 ig_gerintel_desc:0 "The Deutsche Volkspartei, German People's Party (DVP), positions itself as a center-right party supporting right-liberalism, representing the interests of the intelligentsia and the liberal elements of the German population. The party's platform emphasizes secular education, lower tariffs, opposition to welfare spending and agrarian subsidies, and hostility to socialism."
