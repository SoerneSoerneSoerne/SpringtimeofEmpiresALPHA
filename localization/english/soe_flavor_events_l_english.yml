  soe_italy_piedmont.1.t: "Remilitarization of Piedmont"
  soe_italy_piedmont.1.d: "Piedmont has been demilitarized since the end of the Great War, but this insult shall stand no longer! Italy is a sovereign nation and is free to move troops anywhere within her borders!"
  soe_italy_piedmont.1.f: "Diary Entry VII: ‘As our army marched triumphantly into Piedmont, a sense of national pride and purpose surged through our ranks. The memory of being exploited and humiliated following the Great War had haunted us for years, but now, we’re reclaiming our strength and sovereignty. The picturesque landscapes of Piedmont seemed to welcome us back with open arms, and our footsteps echoed with determination. With each step, we carried the weight of history and the hopes of a nation, as our Motherland remilitarized this once-vulnerable region. Our hearts swelled with a renewed sense of duty, ready to defend our homeland and forge a brighter future…’"

  soe_britain_civilwarstart.2.t: "The Birmingham Uprising"
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.2.d: "In the midst of the turbulent times that have engulfed the United Kingdom, the Communist Party of Great Britain has announced their decision. In response to the insurgency led by the fascist vermin Oswald Mosley and his lackeys, the communists will take up arms in Birmingham and its surrounding areas. The British Civil War has erupted, and the communists are determined to free the workers of England from the fascist menace."
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.2.f: "The streets of Birmingham echo with the sounds of revolution as the Communist Party of Great Britain has risen in armed rebellion against the blackshirts of Oswald Mosley. The workers and sympathizers of the communist cause have taken to the barricades, waving the red banner of the hammer and sickle."

  soe_britain_civilwarstart.3.t: "The First Sea Lord's Rebellion"
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.3.d: "In a bold and unexpected move, the Royal Navy, led by the esteemed First Sea Lord, Sir Frederick Field, has seized control of the Plymouth port and the adjacent regions. What was initially a response to the government's call to crush the rebellion in London has taken an unforeseen turn. Field, disillusioned with the government's handling of the crisis, has asserted his independence, and the Royal Navy now operates as a formidable force on its own terms."
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.3.f: "Come cheer up, my lads! 'tis to glory we steer, To add something more to this wonderful year; To honour we call you, as free men not slaves, For who are so free as the sons of the waves?"
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.3.o1: "The sinking ship."

  soe_britain_civilwarstart.4.d: "In a turbulent twist of fate, a group of staunch republicans has come to together to form the Republican Liberation Front, with the vision of establishing a free British republic. Inspired by the historical ideals and revolutionary fervor of the German revolution of 1848, this faction has joined the fray of the British Civil War, seeking to overthrow the existing monarchic order and pave the way for a new era of governance."
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.4.f: "No more the crown, the scepter's might, Shall hold us back from what is right, For we shall rise, we shall reclaim, A destiny built on justice's aim."
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.4.o1: "Curse those Krauts!"
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.4.o2: "The spirit of 1848 shall guide us!"
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.5.t: "The King's Last Stand"
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.5.d: "In the chaos and turmoil of the British Civil War, a group of die-hard monarchists known as the Imperial Loyalists have emerged as the last bastion of support for an absolutist reign of the King. With no functioning government left, these fervent supporters of the monarchy are willing to make the ultimate sacrifice to see their vision of a strong and united Imperial Federation under the King's rule."
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.5.f: "God save our gracious King! Long live our noble King! God save the King! Send him victorious, Happy and glorious, Long to reign over us: God save the King!"
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.5.o1: "Down with the Crown!"

  soe_britain_civilwarstart.7.d: "As the British government descends further into chaos and the streets of London fall under the shadow of fascist occupation, Scotland finds itself at a crossroads. With no effective central authority remaining to govern the entire United Kingdom, the Scottish Parliament has made a historic proclamation: Scotland is free!"
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.7.f: "Who will be a traitor knave? Who will fill a coward's grave? Who's so base as be a slave? Let him turn, and flee. Who for Scotland's King and Law Freedom's sword will strongly draw, Freeman stand or freeman fall, Let him follow me."

  soe_britain_civilwarstart.7.o2: "Scots Wha Hae"
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.6.t: "The Welsh Declaration of Independence"
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.6.d: "In the midst of the chaos gripping the United Kingdom, with the British government in shambles and violent clashes between fascists and communists on the streets, Wales has made a fateful decision. With no functioning central authority to maintain order, the Welsh Parliament has declared the nation's independence, aiming to shield its people from the turbulent conflict that engulfs the rest of the country."
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.6.f: "Mae henwlad fy nhadau yn anwyl i mi, Gwlad beirdd a chantorion, enwogion o fri; Ei gwrol ryfelwyr, gwladgarwyr tra mad, Tros ryddid gollasant eu gwaed. Gwlad, gwlad, pleidiol wyf i'm gwlad, Tra mor yn fur i'r bur hoff bau, O bydded i'r heniaith barhau."

  soe_britain_civilwarstart.16.t: "The Empire on which the Sun never sets"
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.16.d: "In the midst of unprecedented turmoil and chaos, a seismic shift in the global order is unfolding. The once-mighty Imperial Federation, reeling from the collapse of its government and the occupation of London by the Blackshirts, is witnessing the rise of a new era. The streets of Great Britain have become battlefields, as communists and fascists clash for control. In this time of unprecedented uncertainty, the British overseas colonies have made a declaration: they are breaking the chains of colonialism and asserting their independence."
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.16.f: "From the bustling markets of Ceylon to the serene shores of the Caribbean, from the vast African savannas to the remote Pacific islands, the call for freedom has echoed through every corner of the British Empire. The native populations, who for centuries had been subjects of the British Crown, now rise as independent nations in their own right. With the British government in shambles, colonial authorities were left floundering, unable to maintain control. The Blackshirt occupation of London sent shockwaves across the Empire, leaving many colonies feeling abandoned and disillusioned. The vacuum of power in the homeland left a void that local leaders and nationalist movements were all too eager to fill."
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.16.o1: "The sun sets."
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.15.t: "The Land Down Under"
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.15.d: "In a historic and defining moment, Australia and New Zealand have jointly declared their independence from the crumbling Imperial Federation. The once-unquestioning loyalty to the British Crown has given way to a new era of self-determination and unity, as these nations seek to protect their citizens from the ongoing chaos and civil war engulfing Great Britain."
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.15.f: "As London falls into the grip of the Blackshirts and the rest of Britain descends into turmoil, the leadership of Australia and New Zealand recognize the need to act swiftly to secure the safety and prosperity of their people. Australia and New Zealand, two nations bound by geography, shared history, and a desire for a better future, have asserted their sovereignty as independent nations by declaring the independence of the Union of Australasia."
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.15.o1: "These criminals will pay for their actions one day."
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.15.o2: "Onward Australasia!"
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.13.t: "Canada Declares Independence"
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.13.d: "In a historic move echoing the spirit of self-determination and national sovereignty which started in 1848 across Europe, Canada has declared its independence from the Imperial Federation. This step comes in the wake of the British government's collapse due to the ongoing chaos and civil strife engulfing Great Britain. In the face of this turmoil, Canada has acted decisively to secure its future and protect the interests of its citizens. The Dominion of Canada, led by Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, officially declared its independence from the Imperial Federation in a statement delivered from Ottawa."
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.13.f: "In an unexpected turn of events, looking back on their policy of isolationism and non-interventionism, the United States has declared its full support for Canadian independence and has extended a guarantee to intervene should any foreign power attempt to suppress Canada's sovereignty."
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.13.o1: "The Yanks are behind all of this."

  soe_britain_civilwarstart.14.d: "The once-steadfast Imperial government has been rendered impotent, leaving the Empire in a state of uncertainty. Now the Union of South Africa, led by Prime Minister J.B.M. Hertzog, has proclaimed its independence from the British Empire. In a speech delivered from Cape Town, Prime Minister Hertzog expressed South Africa's commitment to charting its own course in these turbulent times."
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.14.f: "South Africa's declaration of independence is driven by a fervent desire for sovereignty and self-determination. The Union, comprising five provinces – the Cape of Good Hope, Natal, Transvaal, the Orange Free State, and Botswana – now stands as a sovereign nation, free from the influence of the British Crown."
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.14.o1: "Anarchy will get them sooner or later."
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.14.o2: "Ex Unitate Vires."
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.1.t: "Blackshirts Occupy London"
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.1.d: "In a shocking turn of events, Oswald Mosley and his Blackshirt paramilitary force have taken control of the heart of the British capital, London. What began as a radical political movement has escalated into a violent struggle for power, as Blackshirts battle government forces and communist factions in the streets, turning the city into a battlefield. At the temporary headquarter of Oswald Mosley's Blackshirts, located in the heart of London, tensions are running high. Gunshots and the sounds of conflict echo outside as government forces and communist militants launch counterattacks. Inside the building, Mosley himself resides, determined to rally his loyalists for the impending conflict."
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.1.f: "From the balcony of the Blackshirt headquarter, Oswald Mosley addresses a fervent crowd of his loyalists, many of whom were armed and ready to defend their cause. Mosley's speech called upon his supporters to stand firm and fight for his vision. "In these troubled times, when the very foundations of our nation are shaken, we must rise to seize our destiny!" Mosley declared, his voice echoing through the chaotic streets. "The Blackshirts are the vanguard of a new order, one that will bring stability and prosperity to our great nation. We shall not be deterred by the forces of disorder and anarchy. England lives and marches on!""
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.1.o1: "Death to Fascism!"
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.1.o2: "England lives!"
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.17.t: "Armory Raided"
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.17.d: "A British armory in a remote part of London was subjected to an assault by forces unknown over the last night. The small group of armed men forced the few guards into a shed, where they were locked in. When the soldiers managed to escape after dawn, they found the armory thoroughly looted. It appears that during the night, the attackers moved away large quantities of material to an unknown location."

  soe_britain_civilwarstart.17.o1: "It must have been the Communists!"

  soe_britain_civilwarstart.18.t: "Hunger Marches"
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.18.d: "In a desperate cry for help, the streets of Great Britain are witnessing a surge of hunger marches as citizens from all walks of life unite in a somber demonstration against the backdrop of a government teetering on the edge of financial ruin. The hushed tones of austerity have given way to cries of anguish as the nation's populace grapples with the harsh realities of economic despair."
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.18.f: "Tens of thousands of disenchanted Britons, their faces etched with despair, have taken to the streets. Marching in ragged columns, they bear placards and banners that cry out for relief from the oppressive weight of unemployment and destitution."
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.18.o1: "Communist agitators, nothing more."
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.19.t: "Police Violence"
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.19.d: "As the hunger marches sweeping across Great Britain continue to swell in size and intensity, the government's response has taken a draconian turn, raising concerns about the erosion of civil liberties and the deepening radicalization of a desperate populace. In recent weeks, the scenes on the streets of major cities and towns across the nation have taken a sinister turn. The rallying cries for economic relief have been met with a heavy-handed police presence, leaving many to wonder if the government's commitment to maintaining law and order has gone too far."
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.19.f: "However, the heavy-handed response has had unintended consequences. As the government clamps down on the demonstrations, the ranks of the disenchanted and radicalized swell. Many among the protesters, pushed to the brink of despair, have turned to more radical ideologies as a means of finding solutions to their woes."

  soe_britain_civilwarstart.20.t: "Buckingham Palace Engulfed in Flames"
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.20.d: "London, November 10, 1929 - Buckingham Palace, the iconic symbol of British monarchy, was engulfed in flames late last night. The devastating inferno has sent shockwaves throughout the nation, further plunging Great Britain into a state of chaos and turmoil. The fire, which erupted in the heart of the palace, raged for hours before firefighters managed to bring it under control. The historic structure, which has stood as a symbol of monarchy for centuries, suffered extensive damage, with entire sections reduced to ashes. The inferno's ferocity left many to wonder whether this was a tragic accident or a deliberate act of arson. Amidst the chaos, King George V, Queen Mary, and their children were evacuated from the palace, escaping the inferno unharmed. The royal family is now residing at a secure, undisclosed location. The King issued a brief statement expressing gratitude for their safety and mourning the loss of the historic palace, an embodiment of British heritage."
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.20.f: "The devastation of Buckingham Palace has shaken the nation to its core and intensified the political turmoil that has been brewing for months. Oswald Mosley, the leader of the British Union of Fascists, has seized upon the opportunity to rally the disenchanted masses behind his fascist ideals. In a fiery speech delivered to throngs of supporters in Trafalgar Square, Mosley declared, "The time for decisive action is upon us. We cannot afford to be held captive by a weak and indecisive government. The very heart of our nation burns, and the specter of communism threatens to consume us all. We need a government that will act swiftly and resolutely to defend our British way of life.""

  soe_britain_civilwarstart.21.t: "Blackshirts March on London"
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.21.d: "In a daring move that has sent shockwaves throughout the nation, Oswald Mosley has led his paramilitary Blackshirts on a march to the heart of the British capital, with the avowed intent of overthrowing the government and seizing power. Inspired by the March on Rome of Gabriele D'Annunzio, Mosley and his fervent followers believe they can achieve a bloodless coup and usher in a new era of fascist rule. While Mosley has expressed his desire for a bloodless transition of power, the prospect of a violent clash remains ever-present, and the nation holds its breath, uncertain of what the coming hours may bring. The fate of the Imperial Federation now hangs in the balance, as a leader and his Blackshirts march towards a bold and uncertain destiny."
  soe_britain_civilwarstart.21.f: "The march began in the early hours of the morning as Mosley, resplendent in his black uniform, addressed his loyal followers in a passionate speech outside the Houses of Parliament. "We march today to restore order and purpose to our great nation," he declared. "Our government has proven itself incapable of defending our British values and way of life. We shall do so ourselves. We say, and I ask you to say it with us, lift up your voices in this great meeting in the heart of England. Send to all the world a message "England lives and marches on!""

The Bundeswehr stands ready to protect, to defend, and to lead."
  soe_germany_greatwar.1.f: "However this modernization wasn’t enough for some. The Prussians seek to further expand the Bundeswehr. We must be cautious not to allow the Bundeswehr to become a pawn in the hands of the Hohenzollern. The Prussian call for expansion must be scrutinized for its true intentions.

  soe_german_monarchy.1.d: "In the heart of Europe, the German Empire stands as a powerful force, united by strength and industry. Yet, beneath its façade of unity lies a delicate balance, a dual power that has held sway for too long - the Austrian and Prussian Diarchy. With Kaiser Karl I of the Habsburg dynasty and Kaiser Wilhelm II of the Hohenzollern lineage at the helm. The Diarchy, born out of historical necessity, has governed Germany through times of turmoil and prosperity. The Habsburgs and Hohenzollerns, bound by an uneasy alliance, have shared the imperial throne, tempering each other's ambitions and desires. While this partnership has united Germany initially in 1848, it has also hindered decisive leadership and slowed the empire's response to external threats."
