 trait_biography_wilhelmina_desc:0 "King William III died on 23 November 1890 and 10-year-old Wilhelmina became Queen of the Netherlands, though her mother was named regent. In 1895, Wilhelmina visited Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom, who penned an evaluation in her diary: "The young Queen ... still has her hair hanging loose. She is very slight & graceful, has fine features, & seems to be very intelligent & a charming child. She speaks English extremely well & has very pretty manners”. On 6 September 1898, Wilhelmina was sworn-in at the Nieuwe Kerk in Amsterdam. She was well aware what was expected by the elected representatives, but was a strong-willed, forceful woman who spoke and acted her mind. She "hated" politicians and instead stated a love for the people. Reflecting popular opinion in the Netherlands at the time, Wilhelmina expressed a level of disdain towards the British for their annexations of the Transvaal Republic and the Orange Free State into the Imperial Federation. The Boers were descended from Dutch colonists who migrated to the region while it was a Dutch colony, and the Dutch people, Wilhelmina included, felt a close level of affinity towards them. In one conversation with her former governess, the Briton Elisabeth Saxton Winter, Wilhelmina referred to the Boer commandos as "excellent shots”. After taking charge of government, Wilhelmina became generally popular for maintaining Dutch neutrality during the First World War and solving many of her country's industrial problems. By that time, her business ventures had made her the world's first female billionaire in dollars."

The manifesto was a call to arms for a new cultural movement that embraced modernity, technology, and dynamism. This marked the birth of Italian Futurism, a movement that sought to break with traditional artistic forms and embrace the innovations of the machine age."

 je_victorsgreatwarstart_reason:0 "After emerging victorious from the Great War, Germany stands as the dominant power on the European continent. However, the spoils of victory have bred complacency within our ranks. We must not let our triumph blind us to the changing tides of warfare. The world is evolving, and so must we. The lessons of the Great War taught us the importance of innovation and adaptation. Our adversaries will not sit idly by while we rest on our laurels. Russia and Italy may have been vanquished, but new challengers are emerging from the ashes of their defeat. The Soviet Union is on the rise, and the Italian State, while weakened by the treaty of Vienna, still possesses immense potential."

Through increased recruitment, modernization of equipment, and the establishment of new divisions, our military forces will grow in strength and readiness. Simultaneously, the restructuring of the General Staff will herald a new era of military leadership and efficiency. Under the guidance of the Prussian leadership, the General Staff will be reorganized to optimize command and control structures, facilitate more streamlined decision-making, and enhance coordination among our various branches of the armed forces."
