 # Biography
 
 trait_biography_maxhohenberg_desc:0 "Maximilian, Duke of Hohenberg is the elder son of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary and his wife Countess Sophie Chotek von Chotkowa und Wognin, Duchess von Hohenberg. Because his parents' marriage was morganatic, he was excluded from succession to the Austrian throne, to which his father was heir presumptive, and to inheritance of any of his father's dynastic titles, income, and properties, although not from the archduke's personal estate nor from his mother's property. Nowadays he reigns as a foreign monarch over the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia."

 trait_biography_wilhelmina_desc:0 "King William III died on 23 November 1890 and 10-year-old Wilhelmina became Queen of the Netherlands, though her mother was named regent. In 1895, Wilhelmina visited Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom, who penned an evaluation in her diary: "The young Queen ... still has her hair hanging loose. She is very slight & graceful, has fine features, & seems to be very intelligent & a charming child. She speaks English extremely well & has very pretty manners”. On 6 September 1898, Wilhelmina was sworn-in at the Nieuwe Kerk in Amsterdam. She was well aware what was expected by the elected representatives, but was a strong-willed, forceful woman who spoke and acted her mind. She "hated" politicians and instead stated a love for the people. Reflecting popular opinion in the Netherlands at the time, Wilhelmina expressed a level of disdain towards the British for their annexations of the Transvaal Republic and the Orange Free State into the Imperial Federation. The Boers were descended from Dutch colonists who migrated to the region while it was a Dutch colony, and the Dutch people, Wilhelmina included, felt a close level of affinity towards them. In one conversation with her former governess, the Briton Elisabeth Saxton Winter, Wilhelmina referred to the Boer commandos as "excellent shots”. After taking charge of government, Wilhelmina became generally popular for maintaining Dutch neutrality during the First World War and solving many of her country's industrial problems. By that time, her business ventures had made her the world's first female billionaire in dollars."

 trait_biography_marinetti_desc:0 "Marinetti was born on December 22, 1876, in Alexandria, Egypt, where his family resided at the time. He later moved to France to study, where he became deeply involved in the literary and artistic avant-garde movements of the early 20th century. His experiences in Paris profoundly influenced his literary and political inclinations. Marinetti is most renowned for his literary work, the "Manifesto of Futurism", published in Le Figaro in 1909. The manifesto was a call to arms for a new cultural movement that embraced modernity, technology, and dynamism. This marked the birth of Italian Futurism, a movement that sought to break with traditional artistic forms and embrace the innovations of the machine age."

The foundations of their economic empires have been shattered, resulting in a worldwide depression with repercussions felt far beyond the borders of France and Germany. It was the pursuit of megalomaniacal construction projects and the relentless drive for colonial expansion that had lured France and Germany into an era of unsustainable ambitions. The colossal hydroelectric dam project in Congo and Chad, hailed as a symbol of modernity and progress, had become a bottomless pit of financial woes."

As the news of the French and German economic collapses spread, panic ensued on a global scale. Investors rushed to withdraw their capital, fearing the domino effect of financial ruin. Banks and businesses began to shutter their doors, and millions of jobs were lost as the world descends into an abyss of uncertainty."
