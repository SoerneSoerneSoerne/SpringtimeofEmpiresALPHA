  Il_Commiato_desc:0 "The artificer in flexing the stem, he saw the ancient wounds on the Sagro, to shine on the Most High and the yearning peplum by Nike. Another is the invisible mountain that he climbs and that you go up by the opposite leap. Alone and apart, both an immortal, anxiety presses you. Now where the brave hearts have promised to meet again one day, if not at the top? That day you will sing a hymn itself on the top. Ode, so he speaks to him. And to the nun, that you will see of sweetness weep, gives the last one that I caught the dawn, lily of the sea."

  Il_Prigioniero_desc:0 "Ardi, you are as sad as the Prisoner, naked that the titan Buonarroto, he drew from what is now, shining from start and from now, Sagro, for the warrior pontiff. Constrict you too are of your mystery, victim consecrated to the Unknown Sea; and your beautiful mouth cries out loud against the fate that you take away the empire. You were tyrant in Gela, triumphal in the ode pitia re? Traesti slaves from Tespe men and marbles to your Thebes?Or on the white horse you were in Mycale, with Pericles' father, and pugnavi with the other youth in the name of Hebe?"
  L_Arca_Romana:0 "L’Arca Romana"
  L_Arca_Romana_desc:0 "Alpe di Luni, and where are the statues? My spirits wish to perpetuate themselves, today on the sky in great simulacra. O ancient marbles in great Roman gardens! Stan for loggias and stairways of balustrades, with their green tunics of mosses. The cypresses, the holm oaks and the bushes are negreggiano, around the fountain where Silence, with his finger on his lips he leans towards the mirror. He sees the skull appearing from the depths of the eternal Medusa, the Gorgóne, he sees himself fixed in the divine horror. The fates lament the cry of the peacock. Everything is stillness of stone, life, what was, grave memory, infinite shadow. I elect a sarcophagus, where it is carved in three faces a battle of Alexander; full is of earth, and bears an oleander. There I will chew the bitter leaf of my laurel, sitting on that ark. Here I will unfold the vana rose of my love, sitting on that ark."
  Pace:0 "Pace"
  Pace_desc:0 "Peace, peace! The beautiful Simonetta, adorned with the fleeting daylily, wanders without escort for, the pale ones, repeat singing new ballad. The hills curve slightly, like wind waves in the sand, of the sea and they do not cast a shadow, almost like air. The Arno speaks with white gravel, going to the Tyrrhenian Nereids, the veil that grace perhaps bathed in it, perhaps the veil waves. Grace this land of Tuscany, exit of the housewife Lana, which was his first art. Peace, peace! Recall your rhyme, in your heart like the bee in your hole. Odi tenzon that up the extreme June, he has the cicada with the lark!"

  Lungo_L_Affrico_desc:0 "Grace of heaven, as sweetly, you look at yourself in the watered earth, soul made beautiful by her tears! Or in a thousand and thousand smiling mirrors, grace, that you were born from a cloud, as voluptuousness arises from tears, music in my song, ota you pour out, which is not fleeting, for me transfigured in high peace, to those who listen to it. Rising Moon, small as in the sky, the eyebrow of the young girl, and the marrow of the new reed, so that the slightest branch hides you, and my eye, if it gets lost, at pain, finds you again, for the dream that tarnishes you, Luna, the river that flows, without a word grassy also saw you; and every blade of grass smiles at you, only to you alone. Or black and white swallows, between night, and dawn, between evening and night, or black and white, guests along the night Affrico! They fly so low that it springs, grass graze with the breasts, and with pleasure, their flight seems blue. Above has no whisper, the great tree, if it always trembles well. It does not weave the flight around my temples, cool wreaths? And it doesn't promise every short cry, a good that perhaps the heart ignores and perhaps, guess if hearing it startles? They linger almost oblivious to the nest, and on the edge where they passed, the tremor of the wing seems to be prolonged. The whole earth seems to be, clay offered to the work of love, a nuncio the cry, and the vespero that dies, a certain dawn."

  La_Vittoria_Navale_desc:0 "If that which weapon of its great feathers, the prow of the trière samotrace, come dee towards me who without peace, I lost my twenty year old effort, not elsewhere but among the living antennas, of this forest born from focace, lito, in view of the silent Alpe, glorious of her perennial candor, I will wait for you saying: "Well you come to me, from the shore that the Cabiri nourish, from the island opposite the Ebro. I am the last son of the Hellenes: I drank from the ancient breast; but with a fiery demon I am drunk.""
